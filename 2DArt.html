            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Caryl and Dolores</h2>
           <p><span style="font-style:italic">"After dying, Delores is transported to a strange world that is neither heaven nor hell. It is purgatory, holding her captive until she can escape its crushing grip. Shortly after she arrives in the new world, she meets a mysterious and strange, Caryl. His attention is riveted on her, showing up everywhere she turns."
 Caryl soon makes it known to Delores that she ended up there because she had committed murder. Even though Delores was an abused wife who was trying to escape her husband, she accepts her fate, acknowledging that she did lead her husband to his death. She understands that her actions had consequences and she should pay the price for his death.
 <br /><br />Traveling this new world, Delores soon realizes that the nefarious creature named Caryl is stalking her. Thinking back to when she first met Caryl, she recognizes that he has been watching and tailing her all along.
 <br /><br />Exploring the purgatory, she has the choice to either find a way to heaven or go to hell. However, she does not only have to cope with various trials, tribulations, and demons, but she has to contend with the devious Caryl.
 <br /><br />She will have reach deep inside herself to find the courage and strength to beat Caryl at his own game."</span><br /><br />This painting was for a painting class and we had to take two characters from a book and have them interact. The books the two character came from are <span style="font-style:italic">Dolores Claiborne</span> by Stephan King and <span style="font-style:italic">Cell 2455 Death Row</span> by Caryl Chessman.
<br /><br />The medium used in this piece was oil paint.</p>
